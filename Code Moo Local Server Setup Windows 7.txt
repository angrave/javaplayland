Here is a quick guide to set up Code Moo locally on your windows machine.

1.	Install XAMPP   http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html and don’t forget to
start apache from the Xampp control panel.

2.	Install Nodejs  http://nodejs.org/
After the installation, open a command prompt.  Enter “npm install -g coffee-script” and you
can validate the installation with “coffee –v”. It will tell you the version if the
installation was successful.

3.	Download the project from https://github.com/angrave/javaplayland

4.	Assume we installed Xampp at c:\xampp, extract the contents of the zip (the outermost folder) 
    to C:\xampp\htdocs so we will have C:\xampp\htdocs\javaplayland-master

5.	Get back to the command prompt and enter “coffee –c C:\xampp\htdocs\javaplayland-master”. This
    will compile all the coffee files into js files.If this does not work try 
    “coffee –c \xampp\htdocs\javaplayland-master” or “coffee –-compile \xampp\htdocs\javaplayland-master”
    Make sure the two dashes in the last version does not somehow become one big dash
    or some other character.

6.	You can access the local version of the project at http://localhost/javaplayland-master/web/ 
    assuming Xampp is running with Apache already started.

After installing, the only thing you need to repeat is to compile the CoffeScript files into JavaScript
files whenever you make any changes to the CoffeScript files (Just do step 5 again).
