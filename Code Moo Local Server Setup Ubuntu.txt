If you are new to Ubuntu and just want to get the local version up and running, you can
use setup_local_version.sh file to do everything for you. You just need to download that
file and run it in the terminal. It will download all required files and setup apache so
you will have a working local copy of the project. If you want to have a local copy as the
working repository for GitHub, you’ll have to setup that additionally.

Installation
1)	Install java 6
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre

2)	Install all the requirements. If you are experienced with linux enough to understand the
side effects purging might cause, look into the node and nodejs package conflict 
(http://askubuntu.com/questions/235655/node-js-conflicts-sbin-node-vs-usr-bin-node/320271#320271) 
and determine how to proceed. 

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get --purge remove node
sudo apt-get --purge remove nodejs

sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g coffee-script

3)	Check everything works with these commands, every call should return a version number
java –version
javac -version
nodejs –v
npm –v
coffee  -v

4)	Install git
sudo apt-get install git-core
git init

5)	We want to use make version 3.82. As of now Ubuntu still uses 3.81. In a terminal type make –v
    If you have 3.82 you can skip the following steps.
1.	This step might be unnecessary but just to make sure there isn’t a version conflict uninstall
    the current make by typing 
sudo apt-get remove make

2.	Go to http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/ and download the file make-3.82.tar.gz. If you are new to
    the terminal extract the folder to your home folder and rename it to make.
    In the terminal type “cd make” to go the folder. If you extracted it elsewhere just go to that folder.

3.	Run these commands
./configure
sudo make install

4.	Close the terminal and open a new one. Type “make –v” you will see 3.82 if everything worked properly.

6)	We need a server to be able to work on a local copy of javaplayland. If you have any preferences
    for which program to use, just go ahead and copy the project from
    https://github.com/angrave/javaplayland to your programs relevant folder and access the project
    through your programs localhost address.

If you are fine with using apache2, just install it with 
sudo apt-get install apache2

apache’s server folder is in “/var/www/” open a terminal and go to that folder with 
cd /var/www
copy the project by
git clone http://github.com/angrave/javaplayland.git
you can access the local version by going to http://localhost/javaplayland/web/ in your browser

You need to compile the coffeescript files before the project works. You can do this with typing the following
in a terminal (assuming you are using apache. If not, change the parameter location to your programs relevant
folder address)

coffee -c /var/www/javaplayland

Remember that you need to recompile these files anytime you make any changes to the coffeescript files.
