In PaintGameState.prototype.highlightCommand in paintGameState.js, there is a hack where we check the line number reported by Doppio to see if it exceeds the user code's line length. If this is true, then we ignore this line number as it comes from library code. This is a hack because we otherwise don't screen for line numbers coming from library code, so library code that does have low line numbers will get through.
