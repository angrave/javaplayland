A primitive variable means the bit sequence stored in memory represents a value. Java supports a handful of primitive types, including int,boolean,char,float and double. These types tell the Java machine how to represent and store a value as bits. The boolean type can only store <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt>. An int type can store an integer value between -two billion and +two billion.<br>Pointers are special.  They don't hold a value directly. Instead they store the memory address of where to find an object i.e. they point to another item in memory. Pointers can hold the special value <tt>null</tt> (meaning they don't point to anything) but primitives cannot. "
